# How to Add a Schoolwork

Schoolwork is the perfect place for you to keep track of your upcoming assignments and tests. This document will show you how to add a new Schoolwork.

1. Tap the `+ Add` button in the upper-right of the screen.
2. In the screen that comes up, there are four sections: **Title**, **Class**, **Due Date**, **Category**, and **Options**. Read more about them below.
3. When you're done, tap `Save`.

## Title 
Here, you can put the title for your assignment or test, such as "Read Chapters 1-3". 

## Class
Here, you can select a class to associate with this Schoolwork. This list is also used in Resources â†’ Classes.

## Due Date
This is where you can set the due date. If you have a specific time that the assignment is due, such as with an online submission, you can set that here as well.

##Category
This is how you can split your assignments and tests. If you enter a title with "quiz", "test", or "exam" in it, the category will automatically be set to Test. You can sort your Schoolwork by category using the sorting options.

## Options
 This is where you can set some other basic options. You can decide if the schoolwork has a due time, set the default due time, and choose where in the list the schoolwork is added (this only affects manual sorting).
