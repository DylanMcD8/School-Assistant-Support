# How to Add a Schoolwork

Schoolwork is the perfect place for you to keep track of your upcoming assignments and tests. This document will show you how to add a new Schoolwork.

## Step One
1. Tap the `+ Add` button in the upper-right of the screen.
2. In the screen that comes up, there are four sections: **Title**, **Class**, **Due Date**, **Category**, and **Options**.
    - **Title** is where you can put the title for your assignment or test, such as "Read Chapters 1-3".
